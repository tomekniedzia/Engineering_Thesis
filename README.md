## General info
This two project are my Engineering thesis. 

### First project present adding some sounds effects: 
* slider to change: Bass, Midtone, Tremble, Gain 
* Echo effect
* Multiple echo effect
* Temolo effect
* Vibrato effect
* Signalsin effect

### Second project use FPGA which enables work with less sample delay (10 micro seconds). Sound effects added:
* Echo effect
* Sinusoidal apperance and disapperance of echoes
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* LabView
* NI myRIO
	
## Setup
To run this project must have myRIO, and LabView. First you have to upload software through connection myRio and PC. Next you have to run code in LabView and program will automatically install all necessary components.
