## General info
These two projects are my Engineering thesis. 

### First project present adding some sounds effects: 
* slider to change: Bass, Midtone, Tremble, Gain 
* Echo effect
* Multiple echo effect
* Tremolo effect
* Vibrato effect
* Signalsin effect

### The Second project uses FPGA, which enables work with less sample delay (10 microseconds). Sound effects added:
* Echo effect
* Sinusoidal appearance and disappearance of echoes
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* LabView
* NI myRIO
	
## Setup
To run this project, you must have myRIO and LabView. First, you have to upload software through connection myRio and PC. Next, you have to run code in LabView, and the program will automatically install all necessary components.
